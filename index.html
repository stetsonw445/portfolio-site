            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I graduated from the University of North Texas College of Engineering with Summa Cum Laude honors for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. During the fall semester of 2022 (my last semester in school), I started working as a Software Engineer for Amdocs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since starting at Amdocs, I have gained numerous skills including working on enterprise level applications for one of the nation's largest telecommunications providers, working with relational databases on an enterprise level, writing custom software to correct errors on service orders, frontend web development, agile development, and so much more. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a true passion for learning and am constantly keeping up to date with the latest technologies and development practices. 
              I am excited to see where my career takes me, and to continue developing my skills with a team of amazing people!
